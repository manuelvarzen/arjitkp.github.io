<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, I am Arjit Kapoor<br><br>I am a graduate in Mechanical Engineering,but I consider myself a data analyst. I am very much intrigued by data sciencee and data visualization, because I beleive that data science enables one to ask hard question and further challenges to seek answers in a novel way.<br>My interest in data science, pushed me to think in terms of data, algorithm and then translating those process into visualization as a medium of storytelling.<br> Apart from that, in my free time I enjoy creating generative art and exploring more on this how AI can be used in generating creative peices. <br> My blog is my journey in exploration into such tarrains.<br> I hope you will enjoy it.</p>

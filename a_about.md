<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, I am Arjit Kapoor<br><br>My background is in Mechanical Engineering,but after exposing myself to data science and analysis, I find myself to be a data analyst. I am very much intrigued by data science and data visualization, because I believe that data science enables one to ask hard questions and further challenges to seek answers in a novel way.<br><br>My interest in data science, pushed me to think in terms of data, algorithm and then translating those process into visualization as a medium of storytelling.<br><br> Apart from that, in my free time I enjoy creating generative art and exploring how AI can be used in a more creative way. <br><br> My blog is my journey in exploration into such terrains.<br><br> I hope you will enjoy what I write.</p>

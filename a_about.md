<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello,I am Arjit Kapoor<br><br> My background is in Mechanical Engineering, but after exposing myself to data science and analysis, I find myself to be a data analyst. I am very much intrigued by data science and data visualization because I believe that data science enables one to ask hard questions and further challenges to seek answers in a novel way.<br><br>My interest in data science pushed me to see things and aspects in an entirely new light in terms of data, algorithms and then later translating those ideas into visualizations that tell a story about it.<br><br>Apart from that, in my free time, I enjoy creating generative art and exploring how AI can be used in a more creative way. <br><br> My blog is my journey in the exploration into such terrains.<br> I hope you will enjoy what I write.</p>
